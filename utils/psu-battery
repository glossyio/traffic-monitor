# Both of the following should appear in /boot/config.txt (/boot/firmware/config.txt)

# Enable maximum current on USB (to override protection??) 
#  To set: `sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt` at end, after [all] add line `usb_max_current_enable=1`
#  The usb_max_current_enable option prevents the limit on USB, but the Pi still assumes a 3A PSU
#  The downside of setting the MAX_CURRENT flag is power brownouts
#  `vcgencmd get_throttled` --  which will tell you if you were running low on power at any point.
# check with following command
vcgencmd get_config usb_max_current_enable


# Tell the RPi to accept the full current (5A)
#  tell the Pi that your PSU is capable of 5A, so the USB current will get the full 1.6A
sudo rpi-eeprom-config --edit
# add line `PSU_MAX_CURRENT=5000`
# reboot system to take effect
