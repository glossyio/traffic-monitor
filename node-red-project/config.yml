    # Optional: future use for auto-provisioning (RPiSN)
    # provisionDeviceKey: 
    # Optional: future use for auto-provisioning (manual)
    # provisionDeviceSecret: 

# Optional: deployment location details
# Note: May be used to determine device placement on maps
# NOTE: Can be overridden at the sensors level, top-level values will cascade down
deployment:
    # NOTE: for address-level accuracy, recommend at least 4 digits after the decimal
    # Optional: Latitude in decimal degrees format; e.g. 45.5225
    lat:
    # Optional: Longitude in decimal degrees format; e.g. -122.6919
    lon:
    # Optional: cardinal (N, S, E, W) or ordinal (NE, NW, SE, etc.) direction the camera/radar is facing 
    # Note: For bearing, match the roadway traffic direction
    bearing:

sensors:
    # Optional: if used, must match the Frigate camera name(s)
    # if not set, no cameras will be used
    cameras:
        # camera name must match Frigate configuration camera names
        picam_264:
            # Optional Enable/disable the camera (default: shown below).

            # camera and radar direction and field of view (FOV) should match
            # Note: name needs to match one defined in `radars` section
