# Where can I get support?

We are a volunteer-driven open source project relying on the generosity of our community to answer questions and offer support. While we strive to assist as many as possible, our capacity is limited, and your patience is appreciated. Your involvement is crucial, and by engaging with us, you help foster a supportive and thriving environment where everyone can benefit from shared knowledge and solutions.

We are also an inclusive community and ask that everyone read and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/glossyio/traffic-monitor/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

We also welcome your contributions! You make the traffic monitor great. For code, troubleshooting, new ideas and more, see [contributing.md](../development/contributing.md "mention").

## Read the docs

The [Traffic Monitor docs](https://docs.trafficmonitor.ai) have a wealth of knowledge and are searchable.

## Search the project repository

After the docs the best place to start is the  [Traffic Monitor project repository](https://github.com/glossyio/traffic-monitor). Look for the search bar in the _upper right corner_ and then filtering for matching discussions, issues, or even code (filter is on the left side of the screen).

## Post on GitHub discussions

The [Traffic Monitor repo discussions](https://github.com/glossyio/traffic-monitor/discussions) board is the next best place to interact with the community.  Hit New Discussion and there are a variety of category templates:&#x20;

* üí¨ [General](https://github.com/glossyio/traffic-monitor/discussions/new?category=general) - Chat about anything and everything here
* üí° [Ideas](https://github.com/glossyio/traffic-monitor/discussions/new?category=ideas) - Share ideas for new features, also vote on ideas
* üó≥Ô∏è [Polls](https://github.com/glossyio/traffic-monitor/discussions/new?category=polls) - Take a vote from the community
* üôè [Q\&A](https://github.com/glossyio/traffic-monitor/discussions/new?category=q-a) - Ask the community for help
* üëê [Show and tell](https://github.com/glossyio/traffic-monitor/discussions/new?category=show-and-tell) - Show off something you've made

## Open a GitHub issue

To open a [Traffic Monitor GitHub issue](https://github.com/glossyio/traffic-monitor/issues), ensure your topic is specific to a bug, request for a new feature, or a detailed technical question that hasn't been addressed in existing discussions. Make sure to provide enough context and detail to help collaborators address the issue effectively.  There are a few issue templates:

* üêû [Bug report](https://github.com/glossyio/traffic-monitor/issues/new?assignees=\&labels=\&projects=\&template=bug_report.md\&title=) - Create a report to help us improve
* üí° [Feature Request](https://github.com/glossyio/traffic-monitor/issues/new?assignees=\&labels=\&projects=\&template=feature_request.md\&title=) - Suggest an idea for this project

Sometimes, a GitHub issue may be closed without a full resolution. This does not imply a lack of concern or interest from the maintainers. Issues may be closed for various reasons, such as duplicate reports, inactivity, or because they are being addressed elsewhere. We encourage continuous community engagement and collaboration to ensure all significant matters are acknowledged and acted upon.

## Chat with us

To foster an interactive community, we also have a [Traffic Monitor Zulip chat](https://trafficmonitor.zulipchat.com/).  This is often where project developers will discuss code contributions, so it is a good place to get started if you are interested in [contributing.md](../development/contributing.md "mention").
