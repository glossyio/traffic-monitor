# Node-RED Config

{% hint style="info" %}
This page is for the Traffic Monitor -specific configuration of the Node-RED flows. This controls much of the logic and flow for the traffic monitor but does not control other applications such as Frigate or the operating system.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
See [frigate-config.md](frigate-config.md "mention") for controlling object detection parameters.
{% endhint %}

## Environment File

The environment file defines variables that can be used during Node-RED start-up in the [settings file](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/runtime/settings-file) and within a flows' node properties.

A sample script can be found at [node-red-project/environment](https://github.com/glossyio/traffic-monitor/blob/main/node-red-project/environment).

The environment file is loaded by the `systemd` service `node-red.service` that is set up during by the [Node-RED Rapsberry Pi Install script](https://nodered.org/docs/getting-started/raspberrypi). It shall be located in the user node-red directory, by default at `~/.node-red/environment`.  Changes to the environment file must be applied by restarting the Node-RED service by executing the command `node-red-restart` in the terminal.

```sh

# This file contains node-red environment variables loaded by node-red.service
#   Read more at https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/environment-variables
#     and https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Systemd
#  
# This file shall be located at the root node-red directory, usually `~/.node-red`
#   this file is loaded by `systemd`, changes can be applied 
#   by running the command `node-red-restart` in the terminal

#
# Uses:
#   - variables can be used in settings.js by calling `process.env.ENV_VAR`
#   - node property can be set by calling `${ENV_VAR}

## Config File

The Traffic Monitor Node-RED config file changes definitions to various services and functionality.&#x20;

The config file is loaded whenever the TM flows restart.  It is located in the user node-red directory,`~/.node-red/config.yml`.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is _not necessary_ to copy this full configuration file. Default values are specified below.
