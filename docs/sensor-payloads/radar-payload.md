# Radar Payload

## Overview

The Doppler radar enables speed and direction measurement to be collected and added to events.

### Hardware

{% hint style="info" %}
See [#radar](../recommended-hardware.md#radar "mention") for more information on selecting a radar unit.

The [OPS243-A](https://omnipresense.com/product/ops243-doppler-radar-sensor/) radar from [OmniPreSense](https://omnipresense.com/):&#x20;

> OmniPreSenseâ€™s OPS243 is complete short-range radar (SRR) solution providing motion detection, speed, direction, and range reporting. All radar signal processing is done on board and a simple API reports the processed data.

### Software

The OPS243 radar sensors include an easy-to-use [API interface](https://omnipresense.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/AN-010-Y_API_Interface.pdf) for returning a variety of radar readings and calculated values in JSON format. By default, we capture all of these values in separate tables:

* **DetectedObjectVelocity** (command `ON`).&#x20;
  * [#radar\_dov-table](radar-payload.md#radar_dov-table "mention")
  * Sensor determines if an object is present by looking for 2 consecutive speed reports. If met, the max speed detected is reported. If a faster speed is detected, additional speeds are reported. This lowers the number of speed reports for a given detected object. Use On to turn the mode off.
* **TimedSpeedCounts** (command @O).&#x20;
  * [#radar\_timed\_speed\_counts-table](radar-payload.md#radar_timed_speed_counts-table "mention").&#x20;
  * Sensor counts and reports the cumulative number of objects (defined by DetectedObjectVelocity) that have gone by in a given period. Default TM setting is reporting every 300-seconds.
* **Raw Speed Magnitude** (command `OS`).&#x20;
  * [#radar\_raw\_speed\_magnitude-table](radar-payload.md#radar_raw_speed_magnitude-table "mention") and [#radar\_raw\_speed\_magnitude\_single-table](radar-payload.md#radar_raw_speed_magnitude_single-table "mention")
  * Reports magnitude and associated speed of each reading. The magnitude is a measure of the size, distance, and reflectivity of the object detected. By default, TM captures the 3-burst speed/magnitude pairs and the single strongest magnitude and associated speed in separate tables for deep dive and easier analysis, respectively.
* **Vehicle Length** (command `OC`).&#x20;
  * Note: _Requires Firmware OPS9243._&#x20;
  * [#radar\_oc\_payload-table](radar-payload.md#radar_oc_payload-table "mention")
  * From the docs: _Provides several parameters which can help identify the vehicle type and/or lane in which the vehicle is located_. This includes start/end time, frames, min/max MPH, magnitude, and length calculations.

## Radar Database

The following attributes are captured, by default, into `tmdb.events.sqlite`:

| velocity\_change      | Delta max\_speed â€“ min\_speed. This can help with indication of the lane a vehicle is in. A vehicle farther to the edge of the FoV will have a higher cosine error change and therefore delta speed. This should be normalized to speed so offline weâ€™ve used (max\_speed â€“ min\_speed)/max\_speed. A lower number tends to show a vehicle in the farther lane over. | REAL              |                                                                                       |
