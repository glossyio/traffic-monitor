# Deployment and Mounting Guide

Deployment encompasses geographic location and bearing, physical hardware mounting, angle of camera and device to roadway, and configuration to make it ready to detect objects.

## Deployment and Mounting

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Warning:** Ensure compliance with all applicable laws and local regulations when installing, mounting, and deploying a traffic monitor, particularly in public spaces. Unauthorized surveillance can lead to legal consequences and infringement of privacy rights. Always consult with legal professionals or local authorities if you are unsure of the requirements. Information in this guide is for educational purposes, and you are responsible for adhering to applicable laws and consequences of the deployment and use of the traffic monitor.

Ensure you are mounting the traffic monitor in an approved area to comply with local regulations, and avoid attaching it to utility poles without proper authorization.
{% endhint %}

### Temporary

The traffic monitor may work very well at head-height mounted anywhere with an unobstructed view of the roadway.  A sturdy camera tripod works well for this situation.

### Permanent

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Safety Note**: When installing the camera, always use proper safety equipment, such as gloves and safety goggles and ladder safety to protect yourself. Ensure that the camera is securely mounted, particularly in public spaces, to prevent tampering or accidental damage. Failure to do so could result in injury or damage to property. Verify that all mounting components are tightly fastened, safety tethers are in place, and check for stability to guarantee safe and reliable operation.

### Choose a mounting location

### Angle the traffic monitor

This will be dependent on the hardware you have chosen to install:

* **The camera** needs an unobstructed view of the roadway for the best performance, but it is able to perform object detection anywhere in the camera frame.
* **The radar** has a narrower field-of-view (FOV) than most cameras and requires specific angles to the roadway for the most accurate speed measurements. You can test this by having someone hold the radar unit (outside of the case) and seeing the red/blue blinking LEDs on the front of the radar as you move towards and away from the unit. Watch the LEDs as objects move through the view and determine the boundaries for drawing the zone.

## Next Steps

Power on the Traffic Monitor (once it is plugged in to a power source it should automatically start, check for the green LED on the board next to the USB-C power slot) and proceed to [setup-guide.md](setup-guide.md "mention") to connect and configure it.
