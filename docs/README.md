# Welcome to smart city traffic monitoring

## Overview

[TrafficMonitor.ai](https://www.trafficmonitor.ai/), the Traffic Monitor, is an open source smart city traffic monitoring software built with commodity hardware to capture holistic roadway usage. Utilizing edge machine learning object detection and Doppler radar, it counts pedestrians, bicycles, and cars and measures vehicle speeds.
