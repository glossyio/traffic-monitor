# Getting Started

The traffic monitor requires the [Recommended Hardware](build-your-own-device-diy/recommended-hardware.md) and [software installation](build-your-own-device-diy/software-installation.md) before you can begin capturing roadway data.

There are two ways to get started:

<table data-card-size="large" data-view="cards"><thead><tr><th></th><th></th><th></th><th data-hidden data-card-cover data-type="files"></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Build It!</strong>  </td><td>See our <a href="build-your-own-device-diy/">Build your own device (DIY)</a> guide. The software is open source and components are available retail.</td><td>Customize to your heart's content.</td><td><a href=".gitbook/assets/tools.svg">tools.svg</a></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Buy It!</strong></td><td>(<em>coming soon)</em></td><td>Purchase a pre-built traffic monitor or kit from the Roadway Biome Project.</td><td><a href=".gitbook/assets/store.svg">store.svg</a></td></tr></tbody></table>
